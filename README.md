# NAO: A Caring, Emotionally Intelligent Robot

This is the final project of the Northwestern MSR project. This project is an extension of the TJBot project last quarter. The goal is to program a NAO into a caring, emotionally intelligent robot using NAO software and Watson Services. The target audience is intended to be all people who want a companion, entertainment, or a support system during difficult times.
